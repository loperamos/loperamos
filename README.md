- 👋 Hi, I’m @loperamos. a.k.a Lope Ramos
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, including coding (hehe, how original), reinforcement learning and how to generalize AI (easy stuff), snowboard and climbing, and pets and nature!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Chiense or 汉语! Unity and rl (pretty cool to be able to see my failures failing in paralel), Climbing and cooking...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... not sure for now, pretty busy on my own projects, but I will be happy to explore new oportunities.
- 📫 How to reach me: easy, email -> loperamosmunoz@gmail.com (who still uses email anyway?) I am also on linkedin: https://fr.linkedin.com/in/loperamosmunoz
